The code is written in C99, using a variant of nrutil.{c,h} with double
precision third order tensors. The output is ANSI text, as plotting in
Matlab or with matplotlib seemed like a fun problem rather than a central
one. 

I am confident if my implementation of these features:
 l_x != l_y != l_z
 dx != dy != dz
 command line options for everything, including which method, physical setup, etc.
 default vaules for when command line options are left out
 FTCS, BE, and CN
 gaussian elimination
 guassian curve with noise
 periodic boundary conditions

These features are broken or suspicious:
 non-zero constant boundary conditions are not correct on CN and BE, not sure where the problem is

These features were not attempted:
 ADI CN
 source term
 runtime performance plotting
